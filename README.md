# PREN 2023/24
The task is to develop a device which, from a random, given pattern of (3D) 
dice arrangements at a remote location (e.g. in another room / city etc.) to create an exact copy 
of the colors and positions of the cubes as precisely and quickly as possible. The copy of the arrangement 
should be created inside the device and be visually and physically accessible from the outside.
